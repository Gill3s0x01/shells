## **Description**

The info.sh script resolves IP addresses for a domain provided as an argument and collects detailed information about the found addresses. It generates two output files:
- A CSV file with information about the found IPs.
- A JSON file with detailed data for each IP.

Additionally, the script displays information about your local machine and the result of the IP resolution for the specified domain.
